    <h1>Football</h1>
    <p>
        Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team 
        sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to 
        propel the ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of 
        the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond 
        the goal line into a rectangular framed goal defended by the opposing side. 
        Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45 minute halves, 
        for a total match time of 90 minutes.
